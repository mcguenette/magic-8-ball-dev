# magic-8-ball-dev

## Description:
This was one of our assignments for school, however we were given free range on how to approach it. 

I decided to create a magic 8 ball (taking it back to the 90s! ðŸ“» ) where you ask a yes or no question and the ball will give an answer.

### The answers currently are:
'No', 'Yes', 'Outlook good', 'Of course!', 'Without a doubt',
'In your dreams', 'Outlook not so good', 'Don\'t count on it',
'Ask again later', 'Signs point to yes'.
